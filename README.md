# New_update_rules


#### These update rules are based on the word docs 'MCMIS Logic - Step 2 and 3' and 'ETL Re-Write Notes 12.5.2019' for updating fleet totals. 

#### For for-hire (less than 25 power units) and owner operators those will happen automatically. Otherwise the fleets will need to be looked at by an analyst.
